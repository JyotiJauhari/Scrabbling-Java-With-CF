# Some important Instructions : 

## For Pull Request: 
Kindly use the  dedicated 'Pull request Template' to send us your pull requests. Using a pull request template just ensures neatness and a proper indentation to the project as well. 

## For Adding Files:
There are two main points which you need to follow when you commit and push your java files before creating a pull request - 


- First, add the java file in a folder with the folder name set to the method's name (the method which you applied/used), and then finally add this folder with the java file in the Main (List Interface) Folder.
- Second, add documentation (in the form of comments explaining the method which you've used ) in 2-3 lines. Moreover also comment out the 'Input' & 'Output' of your program at the end of the code. Further follow proper indentation so that your code is readable to others. ( Check the merged PR's for more information )
